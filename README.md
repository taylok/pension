## Five types of Test doubles
- Dummy
 
  Mainly used to fill in parameter lists
  
- Fake

  A lightweight example of an object that the unit under test requires - e.g. inmemory DB
  
- Stub

  An object that only writes pre-programmed answers - naive implementation
  
- Spy

  Like a stub but with the capability to remember how it was called
  
- Mock

  Configured with expectations which are a description of the calls they expect to recieve during the test
  Only mocks insist in behaviour testing
